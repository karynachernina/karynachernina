Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Karyna, I am twenty years old, living in Odessa, Ukraine.

So, my experience as an ordinary person browsing the Internet proves that "everyone makes mistakes". 
For a long time I began to notice the habit of carefully finding and looking at bugs on sites and often I try to send the "bug report". 
I am pleased when my favorite sites are subsequently fixed and I help people make their work easier.

But, I came to the conclusion that this habit could become my job and start in IT field...

This is how I have come to Quality Assurance ðŸ™Œ.
